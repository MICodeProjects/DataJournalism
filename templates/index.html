    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Traffic accidents are often reduced to the individual; it was because a few drivers were drunk, or the driver was speeding, or a pedestrian didn't look both ways. Prevention measures that target the individual are prevelant too: speed limits and traffic lights are touted as easy ways to get drivers to start behaving better.
    </p>
    <p>But is this true? Are these measures as effective at reducing fatalities as people think? Or, does the street being a 4-way intersection liken the chance of dangerous crashes more than any of these factors? When I started this project, I wanted to understand if environment factors like weather and road type play a role in the rate of car crashes.</p>

    <p>In "Don't be Rash with Car Crash(es)", I compare data from car crashes in Chicago with 1 or injuries with the speed limits, traffic control devices presence, street types, weather, intersection status, lighting, and official cause. I also created a graph documenting where in Chicago the accidents occured and how dangerous they were. When we're building our roads, should wavoid certain street types and nail the trees with speed limits? </p>
      
      <p>What measures, if any, could reduce the chance of dangerous crashes?</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I decided to do car crashes because I am interested in urban planning. I picked data from the police department of Chicago on data.gov because the crash data was very detailed. However, it was nearly a million lines long so I had to remove several factors. It was at this point I decided to only examine crashes with at least one injury in order to condense the data further and focus on causes of only serious crashes.</p>

    <h3>Prototypes</h3>

    <img src="prototype11.jpg" alt="prototype 1 part 2" width="150">
    <p>The first prototype was this: it was a little messy, and I misunderstood the prompt when I put the bar graphs on top of the accident map. After feedback complaining of messiness, readability, and vision, I revised them. I added pie charts and line graphs instead of just bar charts so the reader could understand both the frequency, rate over time, and average danger associated with each factor. </p>

    <br>
    <p>After the prototypes were complete, I made a navbar using bootstrap.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Then, I began the work on the accident map. I used google maps to help me find coordinates on my svg that matched coordinates from the crashe, and coded each crash to increase in radius along with fatalities.</p>
    <p>Finally, I coded the bar graphs. At this point I changed the color scheme from blue in my prototypes to orange and red.</p>
    <p>I coded the pie charts last, as they were the most difficult and required a lot of outside research</p>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>I was surprized by the lack of correlation between speed limit and crash fatalities, and how intersections did not seem to affect </p>
